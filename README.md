# c-plus-plus-game-project
### High-level description of this web application
This is a C++ game project made under the SMFL 2.0 framework for the PC. After recieving certification for *Learning C++ Game Development*, I developed this game to enhance my skills further in C++ and game development. I refined my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and game design.

### NOTE: Using game development engines now: Unity
Since the development of this project, I now use Unity and C# to develop my personal game-making projects.
