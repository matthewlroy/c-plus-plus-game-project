# c-plus-plus-game-project
### High-level description of this web application
This is a C++ game project made under the SMFL 2.0 framework for the PC. After recieving certification for *Learning C++ Game Development*, I developed this game to enhance my skills further in C++ and game development. I refined my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and game design.

This game is a 2D platformer in which you play as a charcter fighting robots. You can shoot other robots with a lazer. There are different floor-type tiles which control your movement. For example, there is tile in which you are not allowed to jump, and another one in which you move slower. You fight robots by shooting them with your own weapon. This weapon can also be upgraded. For example, there is an upgrade that will allow your bullets to "pierce" the nearest enemy and attack up to two enemies at once. There is also a shield upgrade that will protect you from incoming enemy bullets. The goal of the game is to kill all enemy robots.

### NOTE: Using game development engines now: Unity
Since the development of this project, I now use Unity and C# to develop my personal game-making projects.
